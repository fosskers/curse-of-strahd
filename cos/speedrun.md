Speed running is usually the act of completing a video game as fast as
possible, using a variety of tricks not known to the average player.
Speed running *Curse of Strahd* is also possible if the DM colludes
with the players.

Given the scenario:

- the PCs are all Level 3
- the PCs begin in the Village of Barovia (as if Death House were complete)
- the DM has told the players where the Magic Items are

**How fast can Curse of Strahd be completed?**

Suggested route:

- *Sunsword* is in Tser Pool Encampment
- Travel immediately to Castle Ravenloft
- Attune someone to the *Sunsword* (1 hour)
- Get *Staff of Power* from Khazan's crypt
- Strahd is in Sergei's tomb
- Break the *Staff of Power* beside Strahd while he is in sunlight (160 dmg)
- Victory
