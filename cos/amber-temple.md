2x Deadly | X42 | 10,800 | 6x [Vampire Spawn](images/vampire-spawn.png)
2x Deadly | X5 | 11,700 | 3x [Flameskulls](images/flameskull.png) + Arcanaloth
4x Deadly (22) | X27 | 41,000 | Exethanter the [Lich](images/lich.png) (in lair)

Notes:

- Neferon carries a *Robe of Useful Items*.
- Vilnius carries a Shield Guardian command amulet.
- The **2x Deadly** encounter variation in X5 is essentially unwinnable. The
flameskulls have 3/4 cover (+5 AC), and the Arcanaloth can't be targeted
from behind its magical darkness. If the players dispel the darkness, the
Arcanaloth still has 3/4 cover.
- The Arcanaloth can see the X4 balcony, and can target creatures there with
its *Fireball* and *Chain Lightning* spells.
- **Custom:** In his weakened state, it is stated that Exethanter has forgotten
his spells, but still knows his cantrips. To justify his Challenge Rating of 10,
it should be assumed that his **Legendary Resistance**, **Paralyzing Touch**, and
**Legendary Actions** are still available to him. His **Lair Actions** only return
if his mind is restored.

The Amber Sarcophagi
--------------------

It should be made clear to the players that accepting gifts can permanently
alter their characters (i.e. becoming evil). The gifts themselves have a
strange range of negative side-effects, while having *very* nice positive
effects.

Here are some suggestions for handling these effects, contrary to how they
are originally written:

- Spell gifts can be cast once per long rest, and never disappear.
- Time-based gifts don't fade over time (or at least during the adventure).
- A character *could* become a vampire, but not a Lich.
- Zhudun's gift (perfect resurrection) lasts once as written.

**Custom Development**

Smashing all the Sarcophagi will prevent Strahd's return if he is killed.
This fact should be insinuated by Exethanter if his memory is restored.
