# Travel in Barovia

**Custom:** It's the transition of Autumn into Winter. The sun rises at 8
a.m. and sets at 5 p.m.

- Each hex on the map is considered **1/4 mile**.
- Lake Zarovich is ~1 mile wide and 5 miles long.
- Rowboats travel at 1.5mph and can carry 4 people.
- Regardless of hex count, the distance from Raven River Crossroads to
Tsolenka Pass is written as being 7 miles.

Always check for encounters when reaching these locations:

- (F) River Ivlis Crossroads
- (P) Luna River Crossroads
- (R) Raven River Crossroads

Anything marked `(difficult)` is a less-travelled trail, and the party moves
at half speed.
