Vampires are described on pages 295 through 298 of the Monster Manual.
Strahd himself is described all over the *Curse of Strahd* book, but his
stats are on pages 239 and 240.

Here are some notes about vampires that may not have been clear upon first
reading of the above sections.

### In General

Vampires are undead, and thus can be targeted with *Turn Undead* and
similar effects.

A stake to the heart while in their resting place will kill a vampire
spawn outright, but only paralyzes a true vampire (Strahd included).

Any vampire or spawn can be restored to life and have their alignment
returned from **Evil** if they are killed and brought back to life,
or if *Wish* is cast on them.

### Strahd

Strahd differs from normal vampires in the following ways:

- he doesn't need to rest during the day
- he has higher Skill statistics
- he can cast spells
- he has Lair Actions
- he has the Heart of Sorrow
- he is almost always accompanied by minions (CoS p. 239)

Ravenloft is Strahd's *Lair*, so it would have the regional effects described
on page 296 of the Monster Manual.

### Vampire Spawn

A spawn who drinks its master's blood becomes its own, free vampire.

A spawn's bite cannot create new vampires.
