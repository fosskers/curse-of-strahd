The Abbot
---------

**Custom Development**

The Abbot is actually Lander Windriver, a Light Domain Cleric from a
previous adventure, the events of which occured hundreds of years in the
past. Upon his original mortal death he was made into a
[Deva](./images/deva.png), and for the past century has been the keeper of
the Abbey of St. Markovia.

The only evidence of the Abbot's connection to his past is a **Stone Carving
of a Walrus** that he keeps as a momento of his mortal life. The carving can
be found during a search of **S17**, along with:

- Empty wine bottles
- Scraps of food
- Some surgical equipment
- Soiled monk's robes
- A **Manual of Flesh Golems** (DMG p. 180)

The **Manual** can't be used by the party (they don't have enough magical
power), and an attempt to read it will deal **6d6 psychic damage**.
