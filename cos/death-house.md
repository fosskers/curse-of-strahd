It is recommended to start your PCs at Level 2. From a pacing/story perspective,
it doesn't make sense for them to level up when the find the basement stairs,
especially given that:

- You might be in the middle of a session when they find the stairs
- They *need* to be Level 2 to handle the basement
- Level 2 often causes a significant evolution of the PCs (paths/domains/etc.)

Encounters
----------

Challenge below is based on a 4-player party of level 2 characters. Creature
numbers may need to be adjusted for the size of your party. See: [Balancing

**Notes:**

- The Nursemaid's specter will only attack if the players open the door to
the nursery.
- Custom: The Shadows in 31 shouldn't follow the PCs out of the room. They
disappear if the orb is returned.
- The PCs gain the 800 EXP for escaping whether the House is angered or not.

Quest: Rest in Peace
--------------------

*Original Text: p. 217*

Place the children's bones in their crypts, and their spirits will be at
rest. Each PCs gains Inspiration.

Custom Event: Ratka's Fate
--------------------------

*This is an overhaul of the event that occurs in Area 38 (Ritual Chamber).*

From area 30 (Stairs Down), a faint screaming can be heard drifting up the
stairway. Any PC with a Passive Perception of 12 or more can hear it.

From area 35 (Reliquary), the screaming is clearly audible and is quite
histerical. The screaming is coming from Ratka (CN [Bandit
Captain](images/bandit-captain.png)), the Vistana who drove the PCs'
carriage until he was lured into Death House. He has 30hp remaining.

Ratka is latched to an odd contraption; his arms and legs are bound with
leather and chains, and are slowly being twisted out of their sockets by
gears under the floor. When the PCs arrive, his right elbow is already
dislocated. He also wears a metal collar around his neck, attached to a
chain hanging from the ceiling.

Ratka can be freed by either:

- Breaking all four chains (**DC 20 STR**)
- Picking all four locks (**DC 15 DEX**)
- Cutting off his limbs above the leather

The players have **4 rounds** to release Ratka, or his limbs will burst from
their sockets. His torso then hangs by the neck until he dies. 4 rounds
gives about 50% chance of success, party depending.

Freeing Ratka will awaken the [Shambling Mound](images/shambling-mound.png).
His death will otherwise please Death House, and allow the PCs to leave
safely.

**Development**

If Ratka is saved, he will be eternally grateful and very apologetic. Once
taken outside of Death House, he explains to the PCs that they were abducted
in order to introduce them to Madam Eva. He offers to lead them to her.

If Ratka is dead, his father and sister will be deeply saddened if they find
out. If the PCs explain the situation, the Vistani will blaim them for not
saving him, equating it to murder. Damia becomes particularly hostile,
cursing one of the PCs (**DC 13 WIS** save. On fail target gains
vulnerability to slashing damage). Stanimir stops her from doing more,
urging the PCs to see Madam Eva at once.

Event: Escaping Death House
---------------------------

If a creature dies on the Dais in area 38, the House is pleased and the PCs
can leave freely.

Otherwise, they must escape as described on p. 220. For reference:

| Action                    | Check            | On Failure               |
|---------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Dodge a door-scythe       | DC 15 Acrobatics | **2d10 slashing** damage |
| Study a door-scythe       | DC 15 INT        | **2d10 slashing** damage |
| Start turn in smokey room | DC 10 CON        | **1d10 poison** damage   |

Rooms with smoke:

| Location | Name              |
|----------|-------------------|
|       2A | Main Hall         |
|        3 | Den of Wolves     |

Event: Arson

begins to repair itself **1d10 days** later, completing its resurrection
