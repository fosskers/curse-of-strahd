The conclusion of this adventure isn't a simple as the book's Epilogue makes
it out to be. Below is an expanded list, ordered by level of success from the
players' perspective.

The main ending branches can be differentiated by one question: Who rules Barovia?

No One Rules Barovia
--------------------

| Players | Strahd | Rahadin | Patrina | Amber Sar. | Ireena | Sergei |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|------------|--------|--------|
| Alive   | Dead   | Dead    | Dead    | Smashed    | ?      | Dead   |

Strahd is defeated, and not avenged by Rahadin. Patrina was not revived, or
if she was, she was redefeated. The Amber sarcophagi were smashed, banishing
the Dark Powers within and preventing Strahd's revival. The players leave
Barovia, and (perhaps) the locals demolish the castle.

Bonus points for:

- Reuniting Ireena and Sergei's spirit
- Keeping Ezmerelda alive
- Restoring the winery
- Lighting the Argynvostholt beacon

Sergei and Ireena Rule Barovia
------------------------------

| Players | Strahd | Rahadin | Patrina | Amber Sar. | Ireena | Sergei |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|------------|--------|--------|
| Alive   | Dead   | Dead    | Dead    | Smashed    | Alive  | Alive  |

Using the Dark Gift from the Corpse Star, the players revive Sergei. He
helps them slay Strahd, much to Strahd's horror. Ireena is still alive, and
regains her memories when she meets Sergei. They restore the castle, and
rule Barovia justly for the remainder of their mortal lives.

**Variant:** Ireena died sometime during the adventure, so Sergei rules
alone.

Players Rule Barovia
--------------------

| Players | Strahd | Rahadin | Patrina | Amber Sar. | Ireena | Sergei |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|------------|--------|--------|
| Alive   | Dead   | Dead    | Dead    | Intact     | ?      | Dead   |

Having infused their bodies with evil power from the Amber Temple, the
players annihilate Strahd and decide to rule over Barovia themselves. The
Dark Powers oblige them.

Rahadin Rules Barovia
---------------------

| Players | Strahd | Rahadin | Patrina | Amber Sar. | Ireena | Sergei |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|------------|--------|--------|
| Dead    | Dead   | Alive   | Dead    | Smashed    | ?      | ?      |

The players slay Strahd and prevent his revival, but in their fatigue
succumb to Rahadin's vengence. Perhaps Rahadin commits suicide afterward,
instead of assuming rule.

Patrina Rules Barovia
---------------------

| Players | Strahd | Rahadin | Patrina | Amber Sar. | Ireena | Sergei |
|---------|--------|---------|---------|------------|--------|--------|
| Alive   | Dead?  | Dead    | Dead    | ?          | ?      | ?      |

There are a few ways this could happen:

- After defeating Strahd, the players leave Barovia. Patrina seizes vampiric
power from the Amber Temple, and redefeats/enslaves Strahd upon his revival.
She is a Vampire Archmage, after all.

- Strahd defeats the players, but not before they could revive Patrina.
She then defeats Strahd herself, perhaps with Mordenkainen's help.

Either way, the players left Barovia in a worse state than they found it.

Strahd Rules Barovia
--------------------

There are many ways this could happen.

- **Strahd defeats the players.** Business as usual in Barovia. If Ireena is
alive, she becomes a vampire spawn.

- **Barovia defeats the players.** The perils of the land were too much.

- **The players defeat him once, but don't smash the Amber Sarcophagi.**
It's as if the players never came.

Bonus points to Strahd for:

- Turning Ireena
- Turning the players
- Recovering his Tome
- Keeping Rahadin (and other main vampire spawn) alive
- Killing Ezmerelda
- Killing Rictavio
- Re-enslaving Patrina, if she was revived
