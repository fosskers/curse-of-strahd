If the players run into Old Bonegrinder at level 4 with guns blazing, they
will most likely die to the combined power of the hag coven. This section
adds more content, to allow the players to interact with OBG in a meaningful
way, while hopefully learning that it's a deathtrap.

Encounters
----------

Challenge below is based on a 4-player party of level 4 characters.

| Challenge | Location | EXP          | Enemy                                                               |
|-----------|----------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hard (5)  | Anywhere | 1,800        | 1x [Night Hag](images/night-hag.png)                                |
| Deadly    | O1       | 1,800 + N*50 | [Morgantha](images/night-hag.png), Nx [Dretches](images/dretch.png) |
| 2x Deadly | Anywhere | 3,600        | 2x [Night Hag](images/night-hag.png)                                |
| 8x Deadly | Anywhere | 8,700        | 3x [Night Hag](images/night-hag.png) (as a Coven)                   |

Notes:

- If the players refuse to leave the Mill, Morgantha will revert to her Hag
form and attack.
- The Coven breaks if one of the Hags dies, making the encounter
significantly easier.
- If Morgantha is on the first floor, she will summon Dretches to help her.
- Custom: She calls her daughters as a bonus action on her first turn. If
they are only one room apart, they arrive in one turn. Otherwise, they
arrive **1d4 + 1** rounds later.
- Custom: If the PCs get in trouble, call in **1d4 + 1** [Swarms of
Ravens](images/swarm-of-ravens.png).

Custom: The Hags' Schedule
--------------------------

If ran by-the-book, provoking the hags would cause them to form a coven and
annihilate the PCs. Without magic/silver weapons, there isn't much that
low-level PCs can do. The chart here allows DMs to randomize the state of
Old Bonegrinder every time the PCs visit, potentially making it easier to
clear.

**Notes:**

- The first time the players visit OBG, Morgantha should be there regardless
of roll, unless she's already dead.
- Occasionally, Bella and Offalia leave OBG to visit witches who live in the woods.
- At night, all three hags are inside the mill.
- Otherwise, there is only a ~19% chance that all three hags are inside during the
day.

**Morgantha**

| d12    | Location                                   |
|--------|--------------------------------------------|
| 1 - 2  | Selling pastries in the Village of Barovia |
| 3 - 4  | Selling pastries in Vallaki                |
| 5 - 12 | O2                                         |

**Bella Sunbane**

| d12    | Location                        |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| 1 - 3  | Svalich Woods (herb picking)    |
| 4 - 11 | O3                              |
| 12     | Communing with Barovian Witches |

**Offalia Wormwiggle**

| d12    | Location                        |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| 1 - 6  | Tending the garden              |
| 7 - 11 | O3                              |
| 12     | Communing with Barovian Witches |

Custom: Resurrection Services
-----------------------------

If the PCs learn of the hags' true nature and think to ask, the hags will
offer to resurrect a dead PC in exchange for a Barovian child who has a
soul. If the characters bring a child, the hags will cast the Druid spell
*Reincarnate* (PHB p. 271), which will most likely change the PC's race.

**Reward:** -1 Renown to Denizens of Barovia

Custom Event: Night at Old Bonegrinder
--------------------------------------

It's around 2 hours from the OBG Fork to the gates of Vallaki. If the sun is
setting when the party is near OBG, they can petition the hags to let them
sleep there for the night.

Morgantha will accept, provided these conditions:

- They buy some Dream Pastries
- They stay outside in a rotting stable
- They don't "disturb her family's slumber"

During the night, the players can perceive:

- Flocks of bats flying overhead
- Howls of wolves from the nearby forest
- A group of skeletons dancing in the Megalith circle
- Cries/screams of young children coming from the upper floors of the mill

If the players try to enter the Mill at night, a raven will warm them away.
"Leave well enough alone."

Otherwise, the players won't be attacked.

Custom Quest: Claim the Mill
----------------------------

If the players found the **Deed to the Mill** in Death House, they can
attempt to convince the Hags to leave on legal grounds.

If one player succeeds at a **DC 20 Persuasion/Intimidation** check, the
Hags will leave peacefully. They will take all their belongings, including
the children, with them. If a Fortune of Ravenloft is hidden here, it
remains.

Failing diplomacy, the players can attack. Either way, the players now own
Old Bonegrinder.

Quest: Rescue the Kids
----------------------

*Original Text: p. 128*

Their names are Freek and Myrtle, and it is possible to rescue them without
triggering an encounter. The PCs succeed if at least 1 child is saved and
brought to a secure location.

**Reward:** +1 Renown to Denizens of Barovia

Custom Event: Consecrate the Megaliths
--------------------------------------

**Prerequisite:** Reclaim Old Bonegrinder

Clearing away the children's teeth from the stone circle will break the
connection to Ceithlenn, and naturally reconsecrate the area over a period
of 3 days. Casting a *Hallow* spell will restore the stones instantly.

**Reward:** +1 Renown to Servants of the Morninglord
