Encounters
----------

Challenge below is based on a 4-player party of level 6 characters.

| Challenge | Location | EXP    | Enemy                                                |
|-----------|----------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|
| N/A (1)   | V7       | 200    | 1x [Animated Armour](images/animated-armour.png)     |
| Hard (8)  | V1       | 3,900  | Ezmerelda d'Avenir (CoS p. 231)                      |
| Hard (9)  | V2       | 5,000  | 1x [Young Blue Dragon](images/young-blue-dragon.png) |
| 7x Deadly | V4       | 20,000 | 4x [Clay Golems](images/clay-golem.png)*             |

- The *Clay Golems* will not attack unless attacked. Only an attacked unit
will activate. Killing any one unit disables the elevator.

Event: Ezmerelda's Retreat
--------------------------

*Original Text: p. 172*

It is important to note that Ezmerelda has a low chance of staying with the
PCs here if they've destroyed the Tower. She will have to be met again
elsewhere if the PCs want her help.

Custom: Khazan's Phylactery
---------------------------

Page 89 describes Khazan as a powerful mage who became a Lich, but failed to
ascend to demilichdom. In this custom variant, he did not fail.

His phylactery is here, in the secret compartment behind the suit of armour.
It can be destroyed by a strike from Khazan's *Staff of Power*, hidden in
Castle Ravenloft.
