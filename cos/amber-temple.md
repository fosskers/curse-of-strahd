Notes:

- Neferon carries a *Robe of Useful Items*.
- Vilnius carries a Shield Guardian command amulet.
- The **2x Deadly** encounter variation in X5 is essentially unwinnable. The
flameskulls have 3/4 cover (+5 AC), and the Arcanaloth can't be targeted from
behind its magical darkness. If the players dispel the darkness, the Arcanaloth
still has 3/4 cover.
- The Arcanaloth can see the X4 balcony, and can target creatures there with its
*Fireball* and *Chain Lightning* spells.
- **Custom:** In his weakened state, it is stated that Exethanter has forgotten
his spells, but still knows his cantrips. To justify his Challenge Rating of 10,
it should be assumed that his **Legendary Resistance**, **Paralyzing Touch**,
and **Legendary Actions** are still available to him. His **Lair Actions** only
return if his mind is restored.

## Neferon's Hunt

CoS Page 184 describes how the Neferon the Arcanaloth should behave while the
PCs are in the temple. In particular, it is stated that:

> If the arcanaloth loses more than half its hit points, it teleports to the
> temple floor, turns invisible, and flees by the safest route, attacking the
> characters again when it's safe to do so.

Page 311 and 313 of the Monster Manual describe Arcanaloths. Notice that
Arcanaloths:

- Speak all languages and are telepathic.
- Have true sight.
- Can fly freely as their movement.
- Are resistant to many damage types.
- Can turn invisible "at will".
- Can teleport as an action.
- Can protect themselves via *Counterspell*, *Banishment*, and *Mind Blank*.
- Can cause harm via *Fireball*, *Chain Lightning*, and *Finger of Death*.

We can assume that Neferon is very protective of the Amber Temple, and that he
and Exethanter have "an understanding".

Should the PCs corner Neferon, he tries to fool them via *Alter Self* as
described on Page 184. If instead they force him to flee the statue, he will
pursue them about the temple. Conditions:

- Neferon will not face the PCs in open combat.
- He is always invisible while pursuing the PCs, but this guise is momentarily
  lost when he attacks.
- If the PCs take a long rest within the temple, Neferon gains back his HP and
  spell slots.
- He will not attack if the PCs are interacting normally with an NPC or Exethanter.
- He will not attack if the PCs are engaged in a serious encounter.
- If not otherwise barred from entering the room the PCs are in, Neferon will
  cast *Fear* or *Fireball* on the PCs if they attempt to take a short/long
  rest.
- Neferon will specifically target PCs who turn invisible, since he can see them.


## The Amber Sarcophagi

It should be made clear to the players that accepting gifts can permanently
alter their characters (i.e. becoming evil). The gifts themselves have a
strange range of negative side-effects, while having *very* nice positive
effects.

Here are some suggestions for handling these effects, contrary to how they
are originally written:

- Spell gifts can be cast once per long rest, and never disappear.
- Time-based gifts don't fade over time (or at least during the adventure).
- A character *could* become a vampire, but not a Lich.
- Zhudun's gift (perfect resurrection) lasts once as written.

**Custom Development**

Smashing all the Sarcophagi will prevent Strahd's return if he is killed.
This fact should be insinuated by Exethanter if his memory is restored.
