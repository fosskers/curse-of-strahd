**Notes**

- If a bard in your party needs a power boost, consider the *Cli Lyre* or the
  *Canaith Mandolin* instead of the *Doss Lute*.
- *Tasha's Holy Symbol* is not really a magic item, but is the hook for a small
  side-quest that leads to the *Ring of Regeneration* in the Abbey graveyard in
  Krezk.
