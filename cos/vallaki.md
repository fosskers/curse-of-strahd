is found or dies.

The Blue Water Inn
------------------

Describe the door as being unusually heavy. This is because of its
reenforcements for when attacks occur.

The Martikov sons, Brom and Bray, affectionately refer to their father as
ворон (read "voron"), which means "raven" in Russian.

Item | Cost
---- | ----
Bed for the night | 1 ep
Wolf steak | 1 ep
Pint of Purple Grapemash | 3 cp
Pint of Red Dragon Crush | 1 sp

**Rictavio**

From noon to dusk.

d10 | Location
--- | --------
1 - 4 | His private room.
5 - 10 | The taproom.

Quest: Recover the Bones of St. Andral
--------------------------------------

**Reward:** The church is *Hallowed*. +2 Renown to Servants of the Morninglord.

Quest: Rescue Arabelle
----------------------

The counter for her being missing starts the day they discover her gone,
presumably by hearing so from Luvash. If she is not found the same day the
PCs learn of her disappearance, she drowns.

If the players also head to Lake Zarovich directly without meeting Luvash,
Arabelle will be there as described on page 38.

Custom Quest: New Leadership
----------------------------

Either stop Lady Wachter's cult, overthrow the Baron with Wachter's help, or
do away with them both to leave Vallaki in anarchy.

Custom Event: Morgantha's Return
--------------------------------

If the PCs fled (or missed) Old Bonegrinder without killing Morgantha, she
can appear in Vallaki hawking her pastries.

Custom Event: Defend the Inn
----------------------------

This occurs if the players flee during Strahd's attack on the church, and
take refuge in the Inn.
