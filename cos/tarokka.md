My own thought is that the DM should rig the Magic Item locations. From the
numbers below we can see a comparitively high chance that at least one of
the items will appear in Castle Ravenloft. Reviewing the [Magic
Items](./magic-items.md) page, however, shows that the Castle is already
packed with other magic items. A pacing argument can also be made: do you
want your players to find the Sunsword at the Ivlis River Crossroads, the
first time they pass it?
