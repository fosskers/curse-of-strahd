Welcome to *Curse of Strahd: Master Quest*, a DM's supplemental tool for the
Dungeons and Dragons adventure [*Curse of
Strahd*](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/curse-strahd).
This set of documents provides:

- Prepared charts and monster stat blocks for all encounters
- [Roll charts](./rolls.md) for random encounters and common checks
- A [list of distances](./travel.md) between all map locations, and the roll counts involved
- An implementation of the *Renown* system for Barovia
- Explicit quest markings
- Custom quests and developments

Some quests/events in CoS are mentioned in passing, in the middle of a large
text block, like:

> If [Izek] sees [Ireena], he tries to take her by force to the burgomaster's
> mansion.

These are easy to miss. *Master Quest* points these out to make them easier
for DMs to track. It also takes other prewritten Developments to their
logical conclusions. For instance, we suggest answers to questions like
"What happens if Ireena dies?"

*Master Quest* is not a name taken in hubris, but is instead a nod to the
*Legend of Grimrock* mod of the same name, and *Ocarina of Time: Master
Quest* which came before it. It mainly denotes an expansion of content.

Advice for Players
------------------

*Curse of Strahd* is a sandbox adventure, where the fate of the PCs is very
much in their own hands. Tell these to the players when they first arrive in
the Village of Barovia:

- You can do whatever you want.
- Discretion is the better part of valour.

All decisions they make in Barovia stem from these two maxims.
