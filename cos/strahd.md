Strahd's Knowledge
------------------

What does he know at a given point in the adventure? The "state" of Strahd,
if you will.

- Where is Ireena?
- The players are in Barovia.
- The players locations and/or heading.
- If the players found his Tome.
- If his horse is still alive.
- If the Argynvostholt beacon is lit.
- If he wishes to kill Ezmerelda.

Things to Reveal
----------------

The DM knows a lot about Strahd, but the players don't. It's easy to forget
what would be surprising, namely that:

- Strahd is a vampire.
- Strahd appears to take no damage (Heart of Sorrow effect).
- Strahd can cast wizard spells.
- Strahd can take a legendary action between each of their turns (max 3 times).
- Strahd can go out during the day.
- A stake to the heart doesn't kill him.
- Barovia is his personal hell.

Quotes
------

> Round and round the wheel turns... each spin brings the same cast playing
new rolls. Except for me, and except for you.

Strahd is refering to the fact that all souls are trapped in Barovia.

Defeating Strahd
----------------

There are a number of ways of defeating Strahd. Technically he can be killed
at any time, like Lavos from Chrono Trigger. However, like that old classic,
this isn't an easy task. Here are some possibilities:

- A grand battle within the castle (w/ Lair actions)
- At Yester Hill (in his defeated mist form, the castle is too far away)
- Breaking the *Staff of Power* near him
- *Wish*ing away his vampirism with the *Luck Blade*
