if reduced to 0 hitpoints.

Meeting: Village of Barovia
---------------------------

She won't open the door unless she's convinced the players aren't in line
with Strahd. She'll let them in if:

- The players RP well
- A player succeeds at a **DC 15 Deception/Persuasion** check
- Ismark is with the party

Ireena should be described as being the most beautiful women the party has
ever seen.

Make it known that Strahd has visited her, but don't make it clear that she
has been bitten.

Custom Quest: Handle the Body
-----------------------------

This quest triggers if Ireena dies.

- If the players resurrect her, her vampirism is cured.
- If they burn her body, her soul is trapped in Barovia until reborn.
- If they bury her body with a stake through the heart, she will stay dead.
- If she is buried normally, or if the players transport her body, she
becomes a [Vampire Spawn](./images/vampire-spawn.png) the night she dies.
She brings herself to Castle Ravenloft to be by Strahd's side. If she is
killed again and resurrected, her vampirism is cured.

Upon her death, Ismark returns to the Village of Barovia a broken man.

Event: Captured by Izek
-----------------------

If Izek sees Ireena, he will try to take her by force back to the
burgomaster's mansion. If immediately pursued, the players begin a **Chase**
with Izek.

**Custom Development**

He brings her to his room, and when she resists his advances, he ties her up. **1d4 hours later**
he gets Victor to cast *Geas* on her. She falls in love with Izek, but this *Geas* is flawed.
It wears off after 7 days instead of 30, and when it does, Ireena is inflicted with the
*Indefinite Madness* flaw:

> *I've discovered that I really like killing people.*

On the 8th day, she has killed a maid and is shackled in **N3m**. Izek
guards the door. Her madness can be cured by *Greater Restoration*.

Custom Event: Creature of the Night
-----------------------------------

If the players keep Ireena alive, she will gradually succumb to vampirism.

Over the course of their days travelling together, Ireena will:

- Turn paler
- Feel exhausted during the day
- Feel rejuvinated at night
- Stop eating
- Stop sleeping at night entirely
- Attempt to seduce a male party member or NPC, and bite them if she can
- Become a vampire and flee the party

Her nascent vampirism can be cured at any time with *greater restoration*.
