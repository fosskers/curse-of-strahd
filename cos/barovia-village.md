Encounters

Challenge below is based on a 4-player party of level 3 characters. See also
[Occupants of Barovian Houses](rolls/#occupants-of-barovian-houses).

| Challenge  | Location        | EXP   | Enemy                                                |

**Notes:**

- Donavich will try to prevent the PCs from killing his son, and will be
overcome with despair if he dies.
- Custom: Escher only visits if the players decide to stay in the Village
another night after burying the burgomaster. He flees if reduced to half health.
- Custom: There is a bottle of Holy Water on the mantlepiece of the first
floor of the Burgomaster's house. Ismark will tell a PC to throw it at
Escher (**2d6 radiant** on hit).

NPC: Ismark Kolyanovich
-----------------------

Ireena's brother and son of the dead burgomaster. Dies if reduced to 0
hitpoints.

Quest: Bury the Burgomaster
---------------------------

*Original Text: p. 47*

Donavich speaks the following prayer during the burial:

> The sun rises as a life sets. Morninglord, we bask in your glow and are
humbled. Protect us always from evil, as we cannot protect ourselves. Please,
deliver your son from this hell, O Lord.

The funeral and burial take **1d4 + 1 hours**.

Afterwards, Donavich speaks to the players privately. He suggests they take
Ireena as far from the castle as possible. Either the Abbey in Krezk, or Vallaki
as a last resort.

**Custom Development**

Assuming the PCs have agreed to escort Ireena, they then need to decide when to
leave. If they leave immediately, they will evade Escher's attack. However,
night may fall while they're on the road. See [Night at Old
Bonegrinder](bonegrinder/#custom-event-night-at-old-bonegrinder).

Otherwise, Ireena offers their home for the night. However, this is the end of
the second lunar cycle since Strahd first bit Ireena, and he intends to fully
turn her tonight. Strahd himself waits atop a hill in the forest, meditating
over what this night will mean for him. He sends Escher to fetch Ireena in his
stead.

In the middle of the night, Ireena wakes up with a scream. When found in her room,
she is sweating and hyperventilating. She says, panicked:

> "It's here."

Ismark tells her to stay in her room while he takes the PCs downstairs to challenge
"Strahd". He warms them:

- Don't look him in eyes.
- Don't invite him in.

The sound of wolves howling fills the town. When the PCs open the front door,
read:

> A handsome young man with dusty blonde hair stands in the doorway. He wears a
fine purple suit, several rings, and has piercings in his ears. He peers into
the room with confidence.

Ismark is terrified and says nothing. After an opportunity for RPing by the
players, they notice Ireena standing behind them in a trance. Her mouth is agape
and her eyes are wide. Escher says:

> "It's time. Madam, may I come in?"

Ireena says "yes" if not immediately stopped by the PCs. Escher then attacks,
trying to capture Ireena (although he should fail at this). Afterward, Ismark
admits to the PCs that "that wasn't him". Morning comes soon after.

Custom Quest: Escape Barovia
----------------------------

The players may want nothing to do with Barovia and its troubles. If they ask an
acquaintance how to leave, they will be told not to attempt the mist themselves.
The Vistani can leave freely, and sell potions to help travellers do the same.

Quest: Escort Ireena
--------------------

If the characters meet Ismark the Lesser, he will offer them drinks and ask them
to help escort his sister to Vallaki.

**Custom Development**

If Ismark and Ireena are both alive when you arrive at Vallaki, they leave the
party and stay at the Blue Water Inn. **2 days later**, Ismark is crippled by
Izek, and Ireena is captured. However, Izek doesn't try to *Geas* her until the
night the players return to Vallaki and discover Ismark's injury/death.

If Ismark dies before you reach Vallaki, Ireena refuses to stay there alone.

**Development**

*Original Text: p. 156*

If Ireena is brought to the blessed pool (S4) in Krezk, she can reunite with
Sergei and be taken to safety. **Custom:** The PCs receive 2,000 EXP for saving
Ireena in this way.

**Custom Development**

If the players take Ireena to the abbey (and don't interact with the Shrine in
Krezk, or fail its interaction) and they allow the Abbot to meet her, he will
recognize her as Tatyana's reincarnation. He will calmly offer to bring her to
Castle Ravenloft to be with Strahd, and give a rational explanation to the PCs
about how (he believes) doing so will save Barovia.

If the PCs resist, the Abbot will magically transform her clothes into a wedding
dress (ignoring continuity with the dress fetch-quest) and attempt to capture
her, claiming it is for Barovia's salvation. If the players resist him, he will
grapple Ireena on his turn and then attempt escape. If he gets outside, he will
fly her to Castle Ravenloft and present her to Strahd. Strahd marries her and
turns her into a [Vampire Spawn](./images/vampire-spawn.png).

The players can stop the wedding, if they hurry. Strahd plans to marry her at
midnight in Ravenloft's Chapel (K15). The castle is 58 hexes away from Krezk. If
they arrive at the Chapel in time, the Abbot is there to oversee "Barovia's
salvation", and will try to prevent the players from interfering. To consummate
their marriage, Strahd will drink Ireena's blood for the duration of the fight
(1 minute), after which she will die.

- If the Abbot defeats the characters, Strahd gets his good ending.
- If the Abbot is defeated, Strahd will stop drinking Ireena's blood and engage
the characters. If the players manage to escape with Ireena, she will die that
night from blood loss. See [Handling the Body](ireena/#custom-quest-handle-the-body).
