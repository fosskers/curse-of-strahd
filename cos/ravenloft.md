Castle Ravenloft can be visited at any point in the adventure, even multiple
times. For lower-level parties, staying here for long poses a significant
threat.

All encounters assume a 4-player party of level 4 or 9 characters, for contrast.
See also [Random Encounters in Castle
Ravenloft](rolls/#random-encounters-in-castle-ravenloft). Unless stated
otherwise, Strahd encounters listed here only occur if Strahd is to appear there
according to your party's Tarokka reading.

**Notes:**

- Players who enter K88 and pass through K87 *cannot exit this way* unless they
  are Lawful Good.
- While it does not function as an entrance, the players can **leave** through
  the teleportation Brazier in K78.
- Falling from the Overlook (K6) results in instant death, regardless of the
  rules of Fall Damage.

**Notes:**

anywhere. It only appears if the PCs take the groom figurine out of the room.

**Notes:**

- The Rug and Portrait won't attack unless disturbed.
- The Wandering Vampire Spawn are different for each location.
- The Heart of Sorrow and the minions who protect it are high up the shaft, near K58.
  The Heart itself floats ~210 feet from the base of the tower, making ranged
  attacks difficult.
- If the Heart takes damage from anywhere, four **Vampire Spawn** arrive three rounds
  later to counterattack.

## Custom: Khazan the Demilich

Khazan is an Acererak-like Demilich. This means he is not the degenerative form
of Demilich, but the ascended form. His only remains are his skull in Crypt 15
of K84. The Crypt is not considered his layer, so his Challenge Rating is 21
(33,000 EXP). Change the text of this crypt to read:

> A single skull sits atop a marble slab in the center of the crypt. It has
> black opals set in its eye sockets and shards of amber where its teeth should
> be. The floor below the slab is scattered with weapons and other adventuring
> equipment.

The equipment is from adventurers who were absorbed into Khazan's opals. Their
souls were transferred to Khazan's phylactery, which remains in his Tower.

As a Demilich, Khazan managed to comprehend and subvert the elaborate spatial
warping magic that entraps Barovia, projecting his mind to other planes of
existance. He is the only creature to have done so, and Strahd is unaware of
this.

While usually thirsty for souls, Khazan "isn't home" when the players arrive.

**Custom Development**

If your party contains a Warlock, consider the following:

Touching the skull or taking the *Staff of Power* summons Khazan back to
Barovia, whereupon he interacts with your Warlock, offering to become its new
patron. Perhaps this involves a combat encounter with the old patron, or some
other puzzle.

## Custom: Reviving Sergei

This can be done either with the last *Wish* charge of the Luck Blade, or via
the *Resurrection* Dark Gift.
