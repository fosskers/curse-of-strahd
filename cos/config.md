Other
-----

Level-up Mechanic: EXP based, or event based?

Campaign Plans
--------------

Players ride in on the back of a rickety carriage, while the driver tells
them of all the dangers? Is the driver Strahd?

Make a `mkdocs` page for my notes? That's good...

Have *Karma Points*. Points recieved from performing certain actions. They
can get negative points too, for instance if they clear Old Bonegrinder but
fail to save the kids, the kids would starve to death. Similar if the
players don't save Arabelle.

Locations and Milestones
------------------------

The locations and (reasons) where players gain levels.

*TODO: Consider half-levels?* A half-milestone, say.
Random encounter == 0.1 milestone?
Bonegrinder doesn't feel like a full milestone. Well, maybe it does. It's a pretty hard boss battle.

Barovia Village: Clear Death House.
(!) Town of Vallaki: Overthrow the baron?
(!) Old Bonegrinder: Clear out the mill (and return the kids?)
(!) Krezk: (optional) Defeat (or appease?) the Abbot.
(!) Winery: Restore the winery (is this possible)?
Van Richten's Tower: None, but there's info and RP here.
Yester Hill: ???
(!) Argynvostholt: Light the beacon (requires going to Ravenloft once).
Werewolf Den: ???
(!) Berez: Defeat Baba Lysaga.
Tsolenka Pass: None (the Goat's pelt is here)
(!) Amber Temple: Help or defeat the Lich.
Castle Ravenloft: None (lots of magic items here).

Old Bonegrinder
---------------

If called, make the daughters appear in 2d2 rounds.

Strahd's Knowledge
------------------

What does he know at a given point in the adventure? The "state" of Strahd,
if you will.

- Where is Ireena?
- The players are in Barovia.
- The players locations and/or heading.
- If the players found his Tome.
- If his horse is still alive.
- If the Argynvostholt beacon is lit.
- If he wishes to kill Ezmerelda.

Death House
-----------

- Make the players sacrifice an NPC! The carriage driver?
- Maid's room: Don't activate the Maid until they touch the baby bundle.
- Room 34: Put the shapes of two bodies underneath bed covers. These are the **ghasts**.

- On Tarokka:

- Roll attack and damage dice at the same time
- Pass notes to the player with the highest passive perception, letting them
sense something nobody else does.
- "RP Fumble Tables". When anyone rolls a 1, humourously describe what
happens.
