Custom Quest: Retrieve the Wagon
--------------------------------

This quest occurs if the players met Ezmerelda in a place other than Van
Richten's Tower, and her wagon remains intact there.

Ezmerelda will suggest they pick up her wagon so that they can travel faster
over the roads. If the players retrieve the wagon, Ezmerelda teaches them
how to get in and what the command words are.

**Reward:** Flamboyant Vistani Wagon, +1 Renown.

- When riding the Wagon, the players move at a **Fast** pace (4mph) with no
penalty.
- The Wagon cannot be taken into the Barovian woods, as the trees grow too
close together and the ground is too rough.
- The Wagon can be slept in, and all party members fit.
- The wagon's wheels can get stuck near Berez. It takes **1d4** hours to get
it free.

Custom Quest: Free Ezmerelda from Strahd
----------------------------------------

If Strahd wants to kill her, he will capture her once and torture her at Castle
Ravenloft (K74d). Each midnight after her capture, she suffers **one level of
Exhaustion**. If the players free her, Stradh won't pursue her again.

If found alive, she has 1hp, her accumulated exhaustion, no equipment (or
clothing?) and is missing her prosthetic leg (it has been tossed in the corner
of the nearly Torture Chamber, under water).

If found "dead", she has become a vampire spawn. Strahd intends to parade her in
front of Van Richten, before finally destroying them both.

**Reward:** +2 Renown to Vampire Hunters, -1 to Dark Powers

Custom Quest: Free Ezmerelda from the Vistani
---------------------------------------------

This is only possible if the PCs relinquished Ezmerelda to Arrigal at
Argynvostholt. The Vistani intend to whip her the day she is captured, then cut
off a hand as punishment for horse theft the day after.

**Reward:** +2 Renown to Vampire Hunters, -1 to Vistani

Custom Quest: Find her Master
-----------------------------

Ezmerelda petitions the players to help her find her master, Rudolph van
Richten. If they do, he is happy (or not) to see his old pupil, but will urge
them to leave him be. His cover blown, he will flee afterward to his tower, if
it's intact.

**Reward:** +2 Renown to Vampire Hunters
