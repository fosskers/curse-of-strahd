Encounters

Challenge below is based on a 4-player party of level 5 characters.

| Challenge | Location |   EXP | Enemy                                            |
|-----------|----------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| N/A       | W16      |   450 | 1x [Druid](images/druid.png) w/ *Gulthias Staff* |
| Easy      | W20      |   650 | 2x Vine Blights, 1x [Druid](images/druid.png)    |
| Easy      | W14      |   700 | 5x Needle Blights, 1x [Druid](images/druid.png)  |
| Hard      | W9       | 1,050 | 24x Twig Blights, 1x [Druid](images/druid.png)*  |
| Deadly    | W        | 1,500 | 30x Needle Blights (MM p. 32)                    |

**Notes**

- There are four *Swarms of Ravens* in W9 who kill one Twig Blight each per
round.


Quest: Reclaim the Winery
-------------------------

Kill all the Druids and their Blights to free the Winery. This can be done
in three ways:

- A melee outside the Winery, as described on page 174.
- Barricade the Winery doors, picking off each Druid group separately.
- Break / burn the *Gulthias Staff*.

**Reward:** *Gulthias Staff* (CoS p. 221), +2 Renown to Keepers of the Feather

Quest: Deliver the Wine
-----------------------

Davian will send his sons Adrian and Elvir to drive the wagon and deliver
the wine to whichever location the PCs choose. The Wereravens will be pleased,
based on the delivery location:

- Vallaki Vistani: 0 renown (only Vistani are happy)
- Krezk: 1 renown (Davian is happy)
- Blue Water Inn: 2 renown (Davian and Urwin are happy)

**Note:** Rolls for random encounters are to occur once per mile, since the
wagon travels slowly. It is 7.5 miles from the Winery to Vallaki, so make
**7 rolls**. The trip takes **3 hours** to complete.

**Reward:** +0 / +1 / +2 Renown to Keepers of the Feather

Quest: Recover the Stolen Gems
------------------------------

The Druids have one and have embedded it in their Strahd statue. Baba Lysaga
has another, and keeps it in her hut.

**Custom:** Each **Magic Gem** is a *Cone of Regeneration* that has 1 charge.
As an action, a player may spend a charge to cast *Regeneration* as written
on page 271 of the Player's Handbook. The Gem recharges 1 charge every day
at dawn.

**Reward:** +2 Renown to Keepers of the Feather for each Gem returned.

Custom Quest: Recover the Lost Gem
----------------------------------

Personally I think it better if the location of the original lost gem
remains a mystery. If you don't agree, here are suggestions for where the
gem could've gone.

Urwin indeed did not steal the gem the night it went missing, nor was he off
shirking his duties by visiting Danika. The gem was stolen by a group of
three Vistani brothers, who snuck in unseen via Invisibility Potions. Urwin
admits, if asked, that he saw Vistani on the trails nearby the Winery that
day. He also points out that despite the gem being stolen, its boon (namely,
the champagne) has not appeared anywhere since then. He thinks the three
Vistani must have died in the woods the very night they stole the gem.

This would be an excuse to get the PCs to trek into the Svalich Woods and
face its dangers. Where the gem is, or further events surrounding its
recovery would be up to you.
