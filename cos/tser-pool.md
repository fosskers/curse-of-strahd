**Notes:**

- The Vistani here work for Strahd, but are non-hostile.

- Stanimir has different spells, see page 20.
- All Vistani have the ability to curse opponents and cast *Evil Eye* (see p.28).

Tarokka Reading
---------------

*Original text: p. 11*

We suggest that the DM (mostly) rig the Tarokka deck reading in order to
balance pacing, story-telling, and magic item distribution across Barovia.
If PCs get a reading from Madam Eva or Ezmerelda, you will need to
physically rig the deck to produce the desired results. Even if you know the
results ahead of time, still flip through the book as if you don't to maintain
the illusion of randomness.

For further explanations, see the Appendix pages [On the Tarokka Deck](tarokka)
and [Cutting the Werewolf Den](werewolves).

Target | Rigged Location | Tarokka Card | Normal Card
------ | --------------- | ------------ | -----------
Tome of Strahd | Marina's Monument (U5) | 3 of Stars (Enchanter) | 3 of Clubs
Holy Symbol of Ravenkind | Blue Water Inn (N2q) | Master of Coins (Rogue) | 10 of Diamonds
The Sunsword | Beacon of Argynvostholt (Q53) | 4 of Stars (Abjurer) | 4 of Clubs
Strahd's Enemy | Any |  |
Strahd | Any |  |

**Notes:**

- **Custom:** The hilt of the Sunsword was found by Argynvost and hidden in
his keep before he died. It remains in the Beacon room, encased by a giant,
impervious crystal. Returning Argynvost's skull to the keep will release the
blade. Guarding the sword is another duty of the Revenants, who take
pleasure in Strahd's inability to reclaim it.

**Reward:** +2 Renoun to Vistani
